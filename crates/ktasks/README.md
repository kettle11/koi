**WORK IN PROGRESS**

An extremely simple multithreaded executor that works across web and desktop. It seems to work, but it's not battle-tested. The code is a mess right now as well.

Writing executors isn't my expertise, if you spot improvements to be made feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
