/// This crate provides structures and traits shared between the platform backends.
/// Each platform must provide the following:
/// * Structures and implementations for the traits in platform_traits.rs
/// * Means to detect and trigger all events in events.rs
///   Each event has documented behavior that must be conformed to.
///   event_receiver should be used on platforms where calls to a platform
///   functions can trigger events.
