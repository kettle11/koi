`kwasm` is very much in flux and its design is still being figured out.

`kwasm` is a spartan framework to facilitate communication between Javascript and Rust WebAssembly.

Its feature set is very sparse and will feel less magical than something like `wasm-bindgen`. `wasm-bindgen` is a better choice if you want to use a proven standard.

`kwasm` may be useful if you're the sort of person who values incredibly simple code-stacks and minimal dependencies.
